# How to: Use Excel Add-Ins in the Spreadsheet Control

This example illustrates how to use Excel Add-Ins in the SpreadsheetControl.

The application runs MicrosoftÂ® ExcelÂ® in the background to evaluate a custom function located in the Excel Add-In macro code and displays the result in the SpreadsheetControl. The user-defined function SPHEREMASS in the Excel Add-In file calculates the mass of a sphere made of a material with a specified density. If the density is not provided, the density of water is used.
